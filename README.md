# what the website will be about, eventually
media review site!!!!

this includes movies, books, etc (maybe recipes too)

features to add include customer review/rate, “about the creators” page, search menu (searching with keyword/ai) etc
# what we have to do to make this happen
1. learn how to make user-made reviews that automatically generate a page just for that review
2. make the basic HTML outline - no CSS or other languages, yet
3. add other special features like the one mentioned in step #1
4. add CSS to all the pages
5. (optional, so far) add some javascript features or API features (whatever that is)
6. publish the site to github pages (to start, maybe something bigger later)
7. bug fix, etc
